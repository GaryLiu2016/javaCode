Difficulty: Easy
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.




public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        int count = 0;
        if (J == null || S == null || J.length() == 0 || S.length() == 0) {
            return count;
        }
        boolean[] map = new boolean[256];
        for (int i = 0; i < J.length(); i++) {
            map[J.charAt(i)] = true;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < S.length(); j++) {
            if (map[S.charAt(j)]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
